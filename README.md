# Reservation-form

A reservation form that validates an email, phone number and several fields during the form entry and at submission that I made for a Client-Side Scripting class but I went above and beyond for.

Originally we were only supposed to validate the email pattern and that all the entries had been filled out. We also only needed to validate on the form submission.

I thought that this woudl be a good place to showcase some UI skill I've learned in regards to forms, about how ideally they would validate when a user leaves focus of the field. It can be aggravating if the fields validate as you're typing (too often), but it can also be frustrating if it only checks the fields at the very end.

I also added another pattern for the phone number itself, and updated the HTML input types to make it more clear to the user wha type of information they are supposed to input.
